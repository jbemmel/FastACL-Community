# FastACL — Community Edition

A high-performance inline packet-filtering plugin for [FD.io VPP](https://fd.io/),
built for DDoS mitigation at 100 Gbps line rate. FastACL implements the
[RFC 8955](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8955) (IPv4) and
[RFC 8956](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8956) (IPv6) FlowSpec match model as
a VPP feature-arc node, designed to act as a scrubbing data plane driven by an
external detection system (for example FastNetMon) over VPP's CLI and binary API.

Released under the **Apache License 2.0** — the same licence as VPP itself.

Plugin documentation in VPP's own format, covering the classifier architecture,
is at [`src/plugins/fastacl/fastacl.rst`](src/plugins/fastacl/fastacl.rst) — the
location VPP expects a plugin's docs, so it works unchanged if the plugin is
built inside a VPP tree.

## Features

- **All 12 RFC 8955/8956 match types**, IPv4 and IPv6 (dual-stack): destination
  and source prefix, IP protocol, destination/source/either port ranges, ICMP
  type and code, TCP flags (value + bitmask), packet length, DSCP, and fragment
  flags.
- **`drop` and `permit` actions**, with the action type carried in the classifier
  result so the fast path never dereferences the rule pool to discard a packet.
  `permit` matches and forwards unchanged, which is what makes a sample-only rule
  possible; an action is mandatory, because type 0 is `drop` and an omitted one
  would silently discard the traffic a tap rule was added to observe.
- **Per-rule traffic sampling** — an exact (not statistical) 1-in-N ratio per
  rule, with the copy taken *before* the action is applied, so a rule can show
  what it discarded. Delivery is over the kernel
  [psample](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/index.html)
  netlink channel, readable by any ordinary Linux program.
- **TSS classifier** (Tuple Space Search): rules are grouped by mask shape into
  per-shape VPP bihash tables, so lookup cost scales with the number of *distinct
  mask shapes* rather than the number of rules. Keys narrow to a compact 8-byte
  (IPv4) or 16-byte (IPv6) form when the mask allows.
- **Rule ordering** following RFC 8955 §5.1 component-wise precedence, with
  single and batch rule installation.
- **Dual-stack scoping that follows the rule, not the family.** A rule applies
  to the family its addresses name, and to *both* when it names no address —
  so `proto 17 dst-port 53 action drop` filters IPv4 and IPv6, rather than
  silently exempting IPv6.
- **Per-rule and aggregate counters**, including packet/byte totals and
  wire-rate telemetry (pps, L3 bps, and L1 bps accounting for framing overhead).
- **Routed and bridged operation** from one datapath: the filter attaches to the
  `ip4-unicast` / `ip6-unicast` arcs and to `l2-input-ip4` / `l2-input-ip6`.
- **VPP binary API and CLI** for every operation.

The [members-only mode design](docs/members_only_mode.md) targets efficient,
scalable source-network admission for multi-tenant fabrics with high change
rates, using scoped membership and compact lookups. The first prototype provides
configurable IPv4 /24 Bloom-filter storage and a CLI; tenant/service binding,
packet learning, and enforcement remain planned work.

## Building

The plugin builds out-of-tree against installed VPP development packages.

```sh
# Prerequisites: VPP 25.10 or 26.06 dev packages (vpp-dev, libvppinfra-dev)
#                libnl-3 headers (libnl-3-dev, libnl-genl-3-dev) for psample
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -C build -j"$(nproc)"
```

`Release` is production mode. GCC and Clang builds enable `-O3`, loop unrolling,
frame-pointer omission, and link-time optimization (LTO) when supported. These
settings apply to the plugin and every VPP CPU variant. VPP retains its baseline
CPU flags and runtime variant selection, so release artifacts remain portable
across the CPUs supported by VPP. Floating-point checks retain their normal
semantics, including Bloom configuration and expiry validation.

`Debug` and `RelWithDebInfo` use the compiler's normal CMake configuration flags.
To disable the additional production optimization settings, configure with
`-DFASTACL_PRODUCTION_OPTIMIZATION=OFF`.

The result is `build/lib/vpp_plugins/fastacl_plugin.so`. Point VPP at it with a
`plugin_path`, or copy it into VPP's plugin directory:

```
plugins {
  path /path/to/build/lib/vpp_plugins
  plugin fastacl_plugin.so { enable }
}
```

### Development container

Open the repository in VS Code and select **Dev Containers: Reopen in
Container**. The container uses Ubuntu 24.04, the FD.io VPP 25.10 development
and runtime packages (including `libsvm` for the CLI tests), and the compiler,
CMake, Ninja, Python API-generation dependencies,
libnl headers, and GDB. It configures and builds the plugin automatically in
`build/devcontainer`, separate from host builds.

To rebuild inside the container:

```sh
cmake --build build/devcontainer
```

You can also use Docker directly from the repository root:

```sh
docker build -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile -t fastacl-dev:2510 .
docker run --rm -it --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v "$PWD:/workspaces/FastACL-Community" fastacl-dev:2510
cmake -S . -B build/devcontainer -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build/devcontainer
```

The `VPP_REPO` build argument selects the FD.io package repository; use `2606`
for the other version covered by CI. In VS Code, change the argument in
`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and rebuild the container. Development
packages follow the selected repository's available versions. This container
builds the out-of-tree plugin; it does not launch a VPP dataplane or require
privileged container access.

## Quick start

Enable the filter on an interface, then install rules:

```
set interface fastacl TenGigabitEthernet0/0/0

# Drop UDP/53 to a prefix
fastacl rule add order 10 dst 10.0.0.0/24 proto 17 dst-port 53 action drop

# Tap: match and forward, sampling 1 packet in 1000 (pass/accept also work)
fastacl rule add order 15 dst 10.0.0.0/24 action permit sample 1000

# Drop TCP SYN to an IPv6 prefix, sampling 1 packet in 100 before the drop
fastacl rule add order 20 dst6 2001:db8::/32 proto 6 \
    tcp-flags value 0x02 mask 0x02 action drop sample 100

show fastacl rules
show fastacl aggregate-counters
show fastacl tuples

# Per-rule counters are exact and on by default; turn the counter write off
fastacl per-rule-stats disable
fastacl per-rule-stats            # no argument reports the current state
```

`show fastacl tuples` reports how many distinct mask shapes are active — the
quantity that actually drives per-packet classification cost — along with
`chains` / `chained` / `deepest`, which say how many rules share a key and how
long the resulting walk can get.

To read sampled packets, enable the psample channel and attach any psample
consumer:

```
fastacl psample enable
show fastacl sampling
```

### Tuning

One startup-config knob sizes the classifier's hash tables. It is allocated per
rule *shape*, so raise it for large rule sets — a million-rule table runs
`1048576`. Values below `1024` are clamped up.

```
fastacl {
  tss-bihash-buckets 1048576
}
```

(`tss-bihash-memory-mb` is still parsed so old configurations start, but it does
nothing: the classifier's hash tables set `BIHASH_USE_HEAP` and allocate from
the VPP main heap. Size the main heap instead.)

The settings outside the `fastacl` stanza matter as much as the one inside it.
A 32-worker ConnectX-7 box carrying a million rules at 100 GbE runs:

```
memory  { main-heap-size 12G  main-heap-page-size 2M }
statseg { size 12G }
buffers { buffers-per-numa 2097152 }
cpu     { main-core 0  corelist-workers 1-31 }
dpdk {
  dev 0000:81:00.0 {
    num-rx-queues 32  num-tx-queues 32
    num-rx-desc 4096  num-tx-desc 4096
    rss { ipv4 ipv6 l3-src-only }
  }
}
```

- `num-rx-desc` is the one that surprises people. Large RX buffers evict the
  rule table from the last-level cache and every per-rule counter write becomes
  a cache miss; 4096 measures an order of magnitude less ingress loss than 8192
  at a million rules. Nothing in the plugin sets it.
- `statseg size` has to cover the per-rule counters —
  `rules x (workers + 1) x 16` bytes.
- `main-heap-size` has to cover the classifier: every tuple's hash table comes
  off the main heap. 2 MB pages are worth setting.
- `rss { ipv4 ipv6 }` is not optional for dual-stack work. Without `ipv6` in the
  list the NIC hashes the whole family to one queue, and one worker.

## Performance notes

Classification cost is a function of the number of **distinct mask shapes**, not
the number of rules — a thousand rules that share one shape cost roughly the
same as one rule. A rule set spread across many shapes costs proportionally more,
because each shape is a separate hash probe. When sizing a deployment, count
shapes with `show fastacl tuples` rather than counting rules.

Sustaining 100 Gbps at small frame sizes requires the usual VPP data-plane
hygiene: multiple worker threads each pinned to a dedicated core, RSS spreading
traffic across as many receive queues as there are workers, isolated cores
(`isolcpus`, `nohz_full`, `rcu_nocbs`), and C-states limited.

## Relationship to the commercial edition

This Community Edition is a complete, self-contained filter. A separately
licensed commercial edition adds a flexible match engine (arbitrary
offset/length/bitmask conditions), named prefix sets for large IP lists, and
additional actions. Nothing in this repository depends on those components.
